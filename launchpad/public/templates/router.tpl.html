        <h2><a href="http://localhost:8084" target="_blank">Simple Demo Application</a></h2>
        <p>
            A simple web-application with a few static pages.
            This is the first demo site I created, with little or no concern for advanced functionality.
            The pages contain primarily text-based templates.
            None of the routes are dynamic in any way.
            The "Page Not Found" route was retrofitted after it was intially added to the capstone router.

        <p>
            A test bed created to showcase programmatic page navigation,
            including routing to a catchall page when a page is not found.
            Catchall routes can be used for more than just "404 not found" errors.
            Use the form, table of contents, and history on the left to
            test each of the routes.

        <h2><a href="http://localhost:8086" target="_blank">Heavy Bundle Simulation</a></h2>
        <p>
            A simple static site including both lightweight and heavy pages.
            Included to showcase the both the lazy-loading and caching of expensive navigation operations.
            When the user navigates to the pi page, which contains 1,000,000 digits of pi,
            several megabytes of text are downloaded before the route navigation completes.
            The next time the user visits the page, the text itself does not need to be
            downloaded again, although there is still a slight delay for rendering.

        <p>
            A demo using route parameters and and template factories to dynamically construct
            the template for the page the user has requested.
            There are actually only three routes defined, although that allows for
            any number of pages through the use of route parameters.
            Interfaces with the GitHub API to demonstrate promise-based template factories.

        <h4><a href="http://localhost:8082" target="_blank">Synchronous Development Spike</a></h4>
        <p>
            This is the proof-of-concept project that I created initially before starting actual development.
            It is a SPA router that is fully synchronous, using a single bundle for all of the templates rather than
            loading templates lazily as they are needed.
